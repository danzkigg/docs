# Welcome to the EV Charging Management API

## Overview

The EV Charging Management API is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the electric vehicle charging ecosystem. Our API provides developers, charging station operators, and electric vehicle owners with a robust platform to manage RFID cards, charging sessions, charging stations, and user interactions.

## Key Features

- **RFID Card Management**
  - Create and manage user RFID cards
  - Generate unique card identifiers
  - Track card status and user associations

- **Charging Stations**
  - Create and manage charging station locations
  - Configure station connectors
  - Track station performance and status
  - Manage station maintenance and availability

- **Charging Sessions**
  - Start and end charging sessions
  - Detailed session tracking
  - Performance and analytics reporting

- **User Management**
  - Secure user authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Comprehensive user profiles

- **Analytics and Reporting**
  - Dashboard metrics
  - Session analytics
  - Station performance tracking
  - Usage statistics

## Authentication

Our API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication:
- Obtain an access token via login
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header
- Tokens expire and can be refreshed

```bash
# Example Authorization Header
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
```

## API Versions

- **v1**: Current stable version
  - Basic authentication

## Quick Integration Examples

```javascript
// Start a charging session
const startSession = async (cardId) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/sessions/start', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ card_id: cardId })
  });
  
  const sessionData = await response.json();
  return sessionData;
};

// Create a new charging station
const createStation = async (stationData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/stations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(stationData)
  });
  
  const newStation = await response.json();
  return newStation;
};
```
