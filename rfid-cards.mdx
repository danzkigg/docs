## Overview

RFID cards are the primary method of identification and authentication for users in the EV Charging Management API. Each card is uniquely associated with a user and is used to initiate and track charging sessions.

## Card Lifecycle

### Card States
- **Active**: Card is valid and can be used for charging
- **Blocked**: Card is temporarily or permanently disabled
- **Pending**: Card has been created but not yet activated

## Card Identifier Format

Card identifiers follow a specific format:
- Prefix: `EVCharged-`
- Followed by a 6-digit sequential number
- Example: `EVCharged-000001`

## Best Practices

- Always generate a unique card identifier before creating a card
- Verify card status before use
- Implement proper error handling for card operations
- Keep card identifiers confidential

## Common Errors

| Status Code | Error Message | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 400 | Card identifier already exists | Attempt to create a duplicate card |
| 403 | Admins only | Non-admin attempting an admin-only operation |
| 404 | Card not found | Requested card does not exist |

## Code Example: Card Management

```javascript
// Generate a new card identifier
const getNextCardId = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/cards/next-id');
  const { nextIdentifier } = await response.json();
  return nextIdentifier;
};

// Create a new card
const createCard = async (cardIdentifier) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/cards', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ card_identifier: cardIdentifier })
  });

  return await response.json();
};
```
