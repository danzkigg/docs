## Overview

Charging stations are the core infrastructure of the electric vehicle charging network. This API provides comprehensive tools to manage, monitor, and interact with charging station details, connectors, and performance.

## Station Characteristics

### Supported Connector Types
- **Type 1 (J1772)**: Standard AC charging
- **Type 2 (Mennekes)**: Advanced AC charging
- **CHAdeMO**: DC fast charging
- **CCS (Combo)**: Universal DC fast charging
- **Tesla**: Proprietary Tesla charging connector

### Power Ratings
- **AC Charging**: 3.7 kW, 7.4 kW, 11 kW, 22 kW
- **DC Charging**: 50 kW, 150 kW, 350 kW

## Station Status

### Possible Statuses
- **Available**: Station is operational and ready for use
- **Maintenance**: Station is undergoing routine maintenance
- **Error**: Station has technical issues
- **Offline**: Station is temporarily out of service

## Connector Management

Each station can have multiple connectors with different:
- Connector Types
- Power Ratings
- Individual Statuses

## Utility Functions

The API provides utility functions to help with station management:

### Distance Calculation
Calculate distance between two coordinates:
```javascript
calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
// Returns distance in kilometers
```

### Power Rate Estimation
Get power consumption rate:
```javascript
getPowerRate(connectorType, powerRating)
// Returns kW rate for charging
```

### Charging Time Estimation
Estimate charging duration:
```javascript
estimateChargingTime(
  batteryCapacity, 
  currentLevel, 
  targetLevel, 
  connectorType, 
  powerRating
)
// Returns estimated charging time in minutes
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly update station status
- Monitor connector availability
- Implement maintenance scheduling
- Track performance metrics
- Ensure accurate location data

## Common Errors

| Status Code | Error Message | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid station data | Incorrect station information |
| 403 | Not authorized | Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Station not found | Requested station does not exist |
| 500 | Server error | Internal processing error |

## Code Example: Station Management

```javascript
// Create a new charging station
const createStation = async (stationData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/stations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(stationData)
  });

  return await response.json();
};

// Get station statistics
const getStationStats = async (stationId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/sessions/station/${stationId}/stats`);
  return await response.json();
};
```
