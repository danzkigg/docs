### Possible Errors

| Status Code | Error Message | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 403 | Forbidden | Non-admin attempting to delete a station |
| 404 | Station not found | No station exists with the given ID |
| 409 | Deletion prevented | Station has active sessions or dependencies |
| 500 | Internal server error | Unexpected server-side error |

## Deletion Behavior

- Permanently removes the station from the system
- Associated data handling:
  - Active sessions may be anonymized
  - Historical usage data is preserved
  - Connector information is removed
  - Maintenance schedules are archived

## Example

```javascript
const deleteStation = async (stationId, force = false) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/stations/${stationId}?force=${force}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(errorData.message || 'Failed to delete station');
  }

  return await response.json();
};

// Usage example
const removeStation = async (stationId) => {
  try {
    // Attempt soft delete first
    const result = await deleteStation(stationId);
    console.log(result.message);
  } catch (error) {
    // If soft delete fails, force delete
    try {
      const forceResult = await deleteStation(stationId, true);
      console.log(forceResult.message);
    } catch (forceError) {
      console.error('Error deleting station:', forceError);
    }
  }
};
```

## Deletion Scenarios

1. **Standard Deletion**
   - No active charging sessions
   - No pending maintenance
   - Smooth removal process

2. **Force Deletion**
   - Stations with active sessions
   - Pending maintenance schedules
   - Forcefully removes all associated data

## Compliance and Data Management

- Follows data protection regulations
- Maintains comprehensive deletion logs
- Supports data archival and retention policies
- Provides audit trail for administrative actions

## Workflow Considerations

- Verify no active charging sessions
- Check for any financial implications
- Notify relevant stakeholders
- Provide alternative station options

## Best Practices

- Confirm deletion with multiple administrators
- Ensure all active sessions are completed
- Archive critical station historical data
- Communicate station removal to users

## Potential Risks

- Loss of historical charging data
- Disruption to charging infrastructure
- Impact on user expectations
- Potential revenue implications

## Notes

- Irreversible action
- Requires comprehensive administrative review
- Impacts overall charging network management
