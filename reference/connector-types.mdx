# EV Charging Connector Types

## Overview

Electric vehicle charging connectors vary by region, vehicle manufacturer, and charging technology. Our API supports multiple connector types to ensure wide compatibility.

## Supported Connector Types

### 1. Type 1 (J1772)
- **Region**: Primarily North America
- **Charging Type**: AC (Alternating Current)
- **Max Power**: Up to 7.4 kW
- **Characteristics**:
  - Standard for most American electric vehicles
  - Single-phase charging
  - Widely used in older EV models

### 2. Type 2 (Mennekes)
- **Region**: Europe
- **Charging Type**: AC (Alternating Current)
- **Max Power**: Up to 22 kW (three-phase)
- **Characteristics**:
  - European standard connector
  - Supports single and three-phase charging
  - Mandatory in many European countries

### 3. CHAdeMO
- **Region**: Japan, International
- **Charging Type**: DC (Direct Current)
- **Max Power**: Up to 50 kW (standard), 150 kW (fast charging)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Developed by Japanese manufacturers
  - Primarily used in Asian markets
  - Supports bidirectional charging

### 4. CCS (Combined Charging System)
- **Region**: Global
- **Charging Type**: DC (Direct Current)
- **Max Power**: Up to 350 kW
- **Characteristics**:
  - Combines AC and DC charging in one connector
  - Becoming the global standard
  - Supports rapid charging
  - Two variants: CCS1 (North America) and CCS2 (Europe)

### 5. Tesla Connector
- **Region**: Global (Tesla vehicles)
- **Charging Type**: AC and DC
- **Max Power**: Up to 250 kW
- **Characteristics**:
  - Proprietary Tesla technology
  - Used exclusively in Tesla vehicles
  - Supports Supercharger network
  - Different designs for different regions

## Comparison Table

| Connector | Type | Region | Max Power | Charging Speed |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Type 1 | AC | North America | 7.4 kW | Slow |
| Type 2 | AC | Europe | 22 kW | Medium |
| CHAdeMO | DC | Japan | 50-150 kW | Fast |
| CCS | DC | Global | 350 kW | Ultra-Fast |
| Tesla | AC/DC | Global | 250 kW | Ultra-Fast |

## Charging Power Levels

### AC Charging
- **Level 1**: 1.4-3.7 kW (Slow)
- **Level 2**: 7.4-22 kW (Medium)

### DC Charging
- **Level 3**: 50-150 kW (Fast)
- **Level 4**: 150-350 kW (Ultra-Fast)

## Adapter Compatibility

Many modern electric vehicles support multiple connector types through adapters:
- Tesla vehicles can use CCS adapters
- Some European EVs support Type 1 and Type 2
- Adapters help increase charging flexibility

## API Connector Type Handling

When using our API, you can specify connector types using these standardized codes:
- `Type1`
- `Type2`
- `CHAdeMO`
- `CCS`
- `Tesla`

### Example API Request

```json
{
  "connector_type": "CCS",
  "power_rating": 150,
  "status": "available"
}
```

## Future Developments

- Increasing standardization of connectors
- Higher power charging capabilities
- More universal adapter solutions

## Regional Considerations

- Different regions have different charging standards
- Always verify local connector compatibility
- Check vehicle and charging station specifications

## Best Practices

- Understand your vehicle's connector type
- Check charging station compatibility
- Use appropriate adapters when needed
- Consider future charging infrastructure developments
