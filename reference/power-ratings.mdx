# EV Charging Power Ratings

## Overview

Power ratings determine the speed and efficiency of electric vehicle charging. Understanding these ratings is crucial for optimal charging strategy.

## Charging Types

### AC (Alternating Current) Charging
Slower, typically used for home and workplace charging.

| Power Rating | Voltage | Typical Use | Charging Speed | Typical Scenario |
|--------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 3.7 kW | Single-Phase | Home Charging | Slow | Overnight Charging |
| 7.4 kW | Single-Phase | Home/Workplace | Medium | 4-6 Hours Full Charge |
| 11 kW | Three-Phase | Commercial | Medium-Fast | 2-3 Hours Full Charge |
| 22 kW | Three-Phase | Public Stations | Fast | 1-2 Hours Full Charge |

### DC (Direct Current) Charging
Rapid charging, typically used in public charging stations.

| Power Rating | Charging Type | Typical Use | Charging Speed | Range Added per Hour |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 50 kW | Fast Charging | Highway Stations | Very Fast | 200-250 miles |
| 150 kW | Ultra-Fast | Advanced Stations | Extremely Fast | 500-600 miles |
| 350 kW | Extreme Fast | Next-Gen Stations | Near-Instantaneous | 700-800 miles |

## Battery Capacity Considerations

### Battery Size Examples
- **Small EV**: 40 kWh (e.g., Nissan Leaf)
- **Medium EV**: 75 kWh (e.g., Tesla Model 3)
- **Large EV**: 100 kWh (e.g., Tesla Model S)

### Charging Time Calculation

Example for a 75 kWh battery:
- **3.7 kW Charger**: ~20 hours
- **7.4 kW Charger**: ~10 hours
- **22 kW Charger**: ~3.5 hours
- **150 kW DC Charger**: ~30 minutes

## Factors Affecting Charging Speed

1. **Battery Capacity**
2. **Charger Power Rating**
3. **Vehicle Charging Limitations**
4. **Battery Temperature**
5. **State of Charge**

## API Power Rating Representation

In our API, power ratings are represented as numeric values:

```json
{
  "connector_type": "CCS",
  "power_ratings": [
    3.7,   // Slow AC
    7.4,   // Standard AC
    11.0,  // Three-Phase AC
    22.0,  // Fast AC
    50.0,  // DC Fast
    150.0, // DC Ultra-Fast
    350.0  // DC Extreme Fast
  ]
}
```

## Charging Efficiency

### Charging Curve
- Charging is fastest between 20-80% battery
- Slows down near full capacity
- Temperature affects charging efficiency

### Efficiency Factors
- Battery chemistry
- Ambient temperature
- Charging infrastructure
- Vehicle design

## Cost Considerations

| Charging Level | Typical Cost per kWh | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| Home Charging | $0.13 | Cheapest option |
| Public AC | $0.25-$0.40 | Moderate cost |
| Public DC Fast | $0.40-$0.60 | Most expensive |

## Environmental Impact

- Lower power ratings generally more energy-efficient
- DC fast charging has higher environmental cost
- Consider charging during off-peak hours

## Future Trends

- Increasing power ratings
- Faster charging technologies
- More efficient battery designs
- Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities

## Best Practices

1. Know your vehicle's charging capabilities
2. Plan charging around battery size and trip needs
3. Use appropriate power ratings
4. Consider charging infrastructure
5. Monitor battery health

## Safety Considerations

- Always use certified charging equipment
- Follow manufacturer recommendations
- Monitor charging process
- Avoid extreme temperatures
